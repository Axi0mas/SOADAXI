Lyrics<br><br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Hey, hey, hey<br>
Where do you think you're going?<br>
It's so late, late, late<br>
What's wrong?<br>
I said, "I can't stay, do I have to give a reason?<br>
It's just me, me, me, it's what I want<br>
So how did we get here?<br>
Three weeks now, we've been so caught up<br>
Better if we do this on our own<br>
Before I love you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
Before I'm someone you leave behind<br>
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine<br>
Before I love you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
Even if I'm not here to stay<br>
I still want your heart<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah<br>
Fate, fate, fate<br>
Is that what came between us?<br>
Or did we do this on our own?<br>
So how did we get here?<br>
I'm asking myself why I'm so caught up<br>
Better if we do this on our own<br>
Before I love you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
Before I'm someone you leave behind<br>
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine<br>
Before I love you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
Even if I'm not here to stay<br>
I still want your heart<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Your heart for takeaway<br>
Your heart for takeaway, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
Before I love you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
Before I'm someone you leave behind<br>
I'll break your heart so you don't break mine<br>
Before I love you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
I'm gonna leave you (nah, nah, nah)<br>
Even if I'm not here to stay<br>
I still want your heart<br>
