Cambiando completamente la atmosfera y el hilo general que seguíamos en las anteriores canciones,el contenido lírico logra enamorar a cualquiera, una canción positiva,tierna,frágil y sin embargo carga con una gran fuerza emocional.<br><br>

Lyrics<br><br>
Intoxicating your kiss<br>
Intoxicating your lips<br>
Nobody does it like this<br>
I find it hard to resist<br>
Oh oh, feeling out of control, beautifully souled<br>
Whats coming over me?<br>
It's a total eclipse of rationality<br>
I don't usually say this<br>
I don't usually play this game<br>
Yeah I know I'm not faded<br>
But it kind of feels that way<br>
I don't usually say this<br>
But I think I should let you know<br>
The day but baby, I don't, I don't wanna go<br>
How could I go home when I feel like I belong?<br>
In your arms it's like champagne<br>
Feel it pouring in my veins<br>
Yeah I got myself too drunk on you to drive<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (tonight)<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (tonight)<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (uh, uh)<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
Hey are you really this good<br>
Damn are you really this good<br>
Baby you're just like a drug I'd bottle you up if I could<br>
Oh oh, feeling out of control with your kind of close<br>
Whats coming over me?<br>
Its a total eclipse of rationality<br>
I don't usually say this<br>
I don't usually play this game<br>
Yeah I know I'm not faded<br>
But it kind of feels that way<br>
I don't usually say this<br>
But I think I should let you know<br>
That baby, baby I don't, I don't want to go<br>
How could I go home when I feel like I belong?<br>
In your arms it's like champagne<br>
Feel it pouring in my veins<br>
Yeah I got myself too drunk on you to drive<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (tonight)<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (tonight)<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (uh, uh)<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
How could I go home when you're all I want to know?<br>
Come on let me see your face<br>
Its to late for this to end<br>
Yeah I got myself too drunk on you to drive<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
How could I go home when I feel like I belong?<br>
In your arms it's like champagne<br>
Feel it pouring in my veins<br>
Yeah I got myself too drunk on you to drive<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (tonight)<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, tonight (yeah, I'm crashing here tonight)<br>
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (uh, uh)<br>
So I'm crashing here tonight<br>
