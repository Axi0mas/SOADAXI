Lyrics<br><br>
Told me I shouldn't watch<br>
Got in your car, then we were nothing<br>
All the nights in your room, shit we got through<br>
Left in your dust, yeah<br>
Don't know what you got, but I thought we had it<br>
Now I'm supposed to act like it doesn't matter<br>
But I'm writing it down, getting it out<br>
Here's to me hoping<br>
Some day I'll come home<br>
And feel like no one's even gone<br>
Play this at my shows<br>
And know that I've been moving on<br>
Some day I'll go to bed and I'll forget I'm lyin' in your spot<br>
But until some day comes<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
Wish that there was a way I could have saved<br>
One little moment, yeah<br>
Pull it out when I can, handle the pain<br>
And know when it's over<br>
I was so intact on the night I met you<br>
Now I'm making sad songs inside my bedroom<br>
But I'm writing it down, getting it out<br>
Here's to me hoping<br>
Some day I'll come home<br>
And feel like no one's even gone<br>
Play this at my shows<br>
And know that I've been moving on<br>
Some day I'll go to bed and I'll forget I'm lyin' in your spot<br>
But until some day comes<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
Hoo, hoo<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
Hoo, hoo<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
Hoo, hoo<br>
I'll be writing sad songs (sad songs)<br>
Hoo, hoo<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
Some day I'll come home<br>
And feel like no one's even gone<br>
Play this at my shows<br>
And know that I've been moving on<br>
Some day I'll go to bed and I'll forget I'm lyin' in your spot<br>
But until some day comes<br>
I'll be writing sad songs<br>
