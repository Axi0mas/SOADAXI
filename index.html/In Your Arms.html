Lyrics<br><br>
Never seen Mona Lisa up close<br>
But I've seen perfection under your clothes<br>
Yeah, we fell in love and we built a home<br>
Though we may never see the streets of Rome<br>
And I hope it's okay<br>
'Cause the unknown is on its way<br>
If I die in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be<br>
You know I'm not afraid<br>
As long as you're next to me<br>
So tell me, will you hold me<br>
When the curtains close<br>
If I died in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be<br>
Yeah, we may never sleep under Northern Lights<br>
But I've seen the stars flicker in your eyes<br>
And I hope it's okay (it's okay)<br>
'Cause the unknown is on its way<br>
If I died in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be<br>
You know I'm not afraid<br>
As long as you're next to me<br>
So tell me, will you hold me<br>
When the curtains close<br>
If I died in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be<br>
(It's okay)<br>
(It's okay)<br>
If I died in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be<br>
(It's okay)<br>
(It's okay)<br>
Lay me down in the ground by my hometown, girl<br>
We, we never leave<br>
But it feels like we've seen the whole world<br>
A thousand cheers when the tears on your parents' roof<br>
Forget my fears every time that I'm under you<br>
All along, all I needed was you<br>
So I swear, I'm not scared when it's over<br>
If I died in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be<br>
You know I'm not afraid<br>
As long as you're next to me (so tell me<br>)
So tell me, will you hold me<br>
When the curtains close<br>
If I died in your arms<br>
It's right where I'm supposed to be (if I died)<br>
