Descrita en internet como un "Sad boy anthem" la canción se sumerge profundamente en los pensamientos y la mentalidad de un individuo que recientemente experimentó una ruptura, a lo largo de la canción,este se lamenta por las varias razones por las que su supuesta relación pudo haber terminado, el track es una continuación del anterior "Hold on" como si las canciones se hablaran entre sí<br><br>

Lyrics<br>
Did I say something wrong? Did you hear what I was thinking?<br>
Did I talk way too long when I told you all my feelings that night?<br>
Is it you? Is it me? Did you find somebody better?<br>
Someone who isn't me, 'cause I know that I was never your type<br>
Never really your type<br>
Overthinking's got me drinking<br>
Messing with my head, whoa<br>
Tell me what you hate about me<br>
Whatever it is, I'm sorry<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I know I can be dramatic<br>
But everybody said we had it<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart<br>
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart<br>
When you said it was real, guess I really did believe you<br>
Did you fake how you feel when we parked down by the river that night?<br>
That night?<br>
That night when we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car<br>
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December<br>
Whoa<br>
Tell me what you hate about me<br>
Whatever it is, I'm sorry<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I know I can be dramatic<br>
But everybody said we had it<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart<br>
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart<br>
Overthinking's got me drinking<br>
Messing with my head, oh<br>
Tell me what you hate about me (about me)<br>
Whatever it is, I'm sorry (oh, I'm sorry)<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah (oh, I'm sorry), yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I know I can be dramatic (I know I can be)<br>
Everybody said we had it<br>
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah<br>
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart<br>
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart<br>
